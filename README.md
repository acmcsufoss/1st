Fork the repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of [`oss.acmcsuf.com/1st`'s page on GitHub](https://github.com/acmcsufoss/1st). This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command: git clone "url you just copied" where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

`git clone https://github.com/this-is-you/acmcsuf.com.git`

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there): `cd 1st` Now create a branch using the git switch command: `git switch -c your-new-branch-name` For example: `git switch -c add-ethanthatonekid`

## Make necessary changes and commit them

Create a new Markdown file inside `/collaborators/fa24` that looks like `gh-user.md`, where `gh-user` is your GitHub username. Then, inside that file, fill out info in the following format:

```
---
name: ""
githubUsername: ""
message: ""
about: ""
programmingInterests: ""
hobbies: ""
extraLink: ""
---
```

Please refer to any of the example Markdown files from the list of `/contributors`!

At the end, it will be rendered in the HTML page with the following format:

Add those changes to the branch you created using the `git add` command:

```
git add .
```

And commit them with a short description, using the `git commit` command (replace `gh-user` with your GitHub username):

```
git commit -m "Added gh-user.md"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

`git push origin -u add-your-branch-name`

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img src="https://github.com/EvanCPSC/1st/assets/142952307/a3ed5a0a-eccf-4435-85b1-257eb3d38ab5" alt="Compare and pull request visual example" width="800" />

Now submit the pull request.

Soon, someone will be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
